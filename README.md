# BigBrain 3D ROIs

## BigBrain

The BigBrain is the brain of a 65 years old man with no neurological or psychiatric
diseases in clinical records at time of death. The brain was embedded in parafin and
sectioned in 7404 coronal histological sections (20 microns), stained for cell bodies.
The BigBrain is the digitized reconstruction of the hi-res histological sections 
(20 microns isotropic).

## Dataset content

This dataset contains all layer segmentation files related to 
[Konrad Wagstyl's paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/580597v1). 
The layer segmentation files are derived from the BigBrain release 2015 
published in the [BigBrain Project website](https://bigbrainproject.org).

## Reference and more information

The BigBrain dataset is the result of a collaborative effort between the
teams of Dr. Katrin Amunts and Dr. Karl Zilles (Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich)
and Dr. Alan Evans (Montreal Neurological Institute).
